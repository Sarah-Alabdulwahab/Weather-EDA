# Weather-EDA

This project is a simple example of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) done on "Weather" data. 

First I started off by dropping the columns that I did not need and filling in the missing values, then I plotted the columns I had left.
Then, I applied linear regression and random forest classification on the dataset, then evaluated each model based on the metrics that are most commonly used for each model.
