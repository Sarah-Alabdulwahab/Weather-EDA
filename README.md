# Weather-EDA

This project is a simple example of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) done on "Weather" data. 

I started off by exploring the data, dropping the columns that I did not need, filling in the missing values, and then I plotted the columns I had left.
After that, I performed linear regression and random forest classification, then evaluated the results based on the metrics that are most commonly used for each model.
